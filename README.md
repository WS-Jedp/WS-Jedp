## About Me 👩🏾‍🚀
I'm from Medellín, Colombia, where the coffee is a morning routine ☕  
I have been related to software for more than 3 years thanks to **WorldSkills** and **Platzi Master** who guide me to become a better professional day by day.

I'm currently the representative of my state, Antioquia, in the WorldSKills competition in the Web Technologies skill.

## Studies 📖
I like to describe myself as a *NoSoftwareEngineer*, to express that I'm **Not Only A Software Engineer**, I'm always a looking for new knowledge or experience that helps me to understand and enjoy more our world and life in this universe.  
That is why I have some studies such as Multimedia Production and in the near future Physics and Astronomy will be part of my way of seeing life.
